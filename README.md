# MatCal

Radiocarbon (14C) age calibration using Bayesian statistics. Produces publication quality calibration plots, 1 sigma (68.27%) and 2 sigma (95.45%) calibrated age probabilities calculated using highest posterior density, as well as a probability density function of calibrated age for use in age modelling. Calibration output can be in either cal BP or BCE/CE (BC/AD), and a reservoir age can be specified if necessary. The user can choose from a number of calibration curves, including the latest version of IntCal.
